<h1>Items moved back to the backlog after they were started</h1>
<p>
  This configuration is set to "reset the clock" if an item is moved back to the backlog after it's
  been discarded. This hides important information and makes the data less accurate. <b>Moving items
  back to the backlog is strongly discouraged.</b>
<p>
  <%= format_integer messages.collect {|issue, days_ignored, details| issue.key}.uniq.size %> issues were moved back
  to the backlog after they were started, ignoring
  <%= format_integer messages.collect {|issue, days_ignored, details| days_ignored}.sum %> days that they were potentially
  being worked on.
</p>
<p>
  "Days ignored" refers to the number of days of data that we have discarded. This is most likely time
  that we legitimately spent working on the item and that we are now pretending didn't happen. This makes
  the data less predictable and generally less accurate.
